	"Changelog": "Build 2024.4.27.1067\n- Moved to local compilation over GitHub to prevent false positives with AntiVirus vendors.\n- Removed unnecessary OpenSSL export.\n- Added check to prevent loading Nexus into a process that isn't GW2.\n- Fixed some logic related to disabling volatile addons and when they are being notified.\n- Changed the QuickAccess offset setting to a DragSlider.\n- Fixed addon config not saving when toggling auto-updates.\n- Fixed a crash when importing certain settings from ArcDPS and the config file was malformed.\n- Added Monospace font for certain Debug UI elements.\n- Added a notification text when manually updating addons telling the user whether the addon was updated or is up-to-date.\n- Fixed an internal crash of the loader in certain scenarios, preventing automatically picking up new addons or updates.\n\nBuild 2024.4.21.1287\n- Removed Google Analytics. It was used to send an event when logging into the game to count unique Nexus users for the public release.\n\nBuild 2024.4.21.1070\n- Removed Nexus loading ArcDPS plugins at runtime, to prevent a rare client crash. Might be added back in the future with a fix.\n- Changed addon FreeLibrary logic to call only once as Nexus calls LoadLibrary only once.\n- Fixed addons not saving (specifically ArcDPS) if they were set to  load on next game start.\n\nBuild 2024.4.20.939\n- Added the event \"EV_VOLATILE_ADDON_DISABLED\" individually per addon. Payload is addon signature.\n- Fixed a scenario in which changing the state of some addons would not be saved.- Removed the \"Last-Modified\" header check for EUpdateProvider::Direct. It was causing more issues than helping. It will be reintroduced at a later date.\n- Added addon flag \"OnlyLoadDuringGameLaunchSequence\" for addons like ArcDPS that can not be loaded later.\n- Fixed addons loading anyway when they updated, even if their state was disabled.\n\nBuild 2024.4.16.1166\n- Fixed ArcDPS Library showing already installed plugins as downloadable.\n- Added events for Unofficial Extras."
