It was used to send an event when logging into the game to count unique Nexus users for the public release.\n\nBuild 2024.4.21.1070\n- Removed Nexus loading ArcDPS plugins at runtime, to prevent a rare client crash. Might be added back in the future with a fix.\n- Changed addon FreeLibrary logic to call only once as Nexus calls LoadLibrary only once.\n- Fixed addons not saving (specifically ArcDPS) if they were set to  load on next game start.\n\nBuild 2024.4.20.939\n- Added the event \"EV_VOLATILE_ADDON_DISABLED\" individually per addon. Payload is addon signature.\n- Fixed a scenario in which changing the state of some addons would not be saved.- Removed the \"Last-Modified\" header check for EUpdateProvider::Direct.
